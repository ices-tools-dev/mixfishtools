**WGMIXFISH Best Practices document**

This document provides a methodological framework showing decision-making processes and "best practice" recommendations for the implementation of models for mixed fisheries advice. Guidance is meant to feature general approaches that apply across case studies, while further ecoregion-specific details are found in their respective Stock Annexes.

-   Word [<https://github.com/ices-tools-dev/mixfishtools/blob/main/doc/WGMIXFISH_best_practices.docx>]

-   Rmarkdown [<https://github.com/ices-tools-dev/mixfishtools/blob/main/vignettes/BestPractices.Rmd>]
